# Blog Site with Comment Section

Simple client-side blog with comment section (MVP) built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Posts and comments are stored in browser `localStorage`.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — styling
- `script.js` — JS logic (create posts, view posts, add/edit/delete comments)
- `README.md` — this file

## How to run locally
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open with...).
2. Create a new post using the form.
3. Click a post title to open it and add comments in the comment box.

## How to publish (Git + GitHub + GitHub Pages)
1. Initialize a git repo and commit the files:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - blog with comment section"
